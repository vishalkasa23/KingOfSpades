# Overview (Appium-Android)
This sample includes an APK file and a pre-written Appium test suite prepared for running in AppCenter/Test or testcloud.xamarin.com. Please see this document for information on preparing an existing Appium test suite for running in AppCenter: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/preparing-for-upload/appium

# Installation
If you haven't previously set up Appium, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Install `Node.js/NPM`: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
2. Install Appium:
   - **Windows** This guide shows how to install Appium on Windows: https://www.edgewordstraining.co.uk/2017/07/05/install-appium-server-windows/

   - **OSX** Use this command in the Terminal (This may require additional permission arguments to work: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17268): 
   > `sudo npm install -g appium`

3. Install Maven:
https://maven.apache.org/install.html

4. Set the ANDROID_HOME path enviroment variable. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28296237/set-android-home-environment-variable-in-mac

By default typically the Android SDK is located at `~/Library/Android/sdk` (Mac) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\sdk` (Windows)
 

# Building & running locally
(Note: The author of this sample used IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3.4 (Ultimate Edition) on Mac OS X 10.13.3, though other tools for building may work.)

1. Provide the absolute path to swiftnote.apk here: [Maven/src/test/java/com/microsoft/altframeworktraining/StartAppTest.java#L32](Maven/src/test/java/com/microsoft/altframeworktraining/StartAppTest.java#L32) 
2. Build the Maven project using your perferred method. Your IDE may prompt you to auto-apply some settings, in which case confirm them. 
3. Make sure to start the local Appium server before running tests, otherwise the tests will fail. 

# Uploading app & tests
1. Build the Maven project.
2. Generate a command line for upload. [Directions](/../../#upload-commands)
3. Run the upload command with project-specific arguments:
   - **OS X** paste your command as the value for 'AppCenter_Test_Command' in 'upload.sh'. In terminal navigate to the Maven folder and run 'sh upload.sh' to generate the 'test/upload' folder and then upload to AppCenter/Test
   - **Windows** The 'upload.sh' file is not technically compatible with Windows, however it shows how to modify the generated command to upload this sample manually.

# Troubleshooting tips
### WebDriverException 
> org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: It is impossible to create a new session because 'createSession' which takes HttpClient, InputStream and long was not found or it is not accessible

One way to reproduce this issue is if you have an invalid path to the APK as noted in Step #1 of the [Building & Running locally directions](#building--running-locally). It is unknown if other causes may trigger this specific error message to appear.
